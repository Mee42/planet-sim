# Planet Sim, 3 :tada:

This repo has all the code for the Planet Sim 3 Discord Bot.



### How to run


First we need to startup the database
```bash
cd test-server
docker-compose up -d
# if on windows, do docker compose up -d
cd ..
```

Then you can run the main file. The process expects `key.txt` to exist and follow this format:
```
Database root password
Discord bot token
Developer Name
```
